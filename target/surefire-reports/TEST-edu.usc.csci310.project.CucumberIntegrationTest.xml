Oooh, ooh...
Oooh, ooh...
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?

'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness



I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice

By once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times

So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight

'Cause I just need one more shot at second chance



Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

Is it too late now to say sorry?

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



Ooh, ooh... I'm sorry, yeah

Ooh, ooh... Sorry, yeah

Ooh, ooh.. Sorry

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



Ooh, ooh... 



I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to

But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two

I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth

Can we both say the words and forget this? Yeah



Is it too late now to say sorry?

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

Is it too late now to say sorry?

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



I'm not just trying to get you back on me (oh no no)

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

Is it too late now to say sorry?

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?





Ooh, ooh... I'm sorry, yeah

Ooh, ooh... Sorry, oh

Ooh, ooh... Sorry

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



Ooh, ooh... I'm sorry, yeah

Ooh, ooh... Sorry, oh

Ooh, ooh... Sorry

Yeah I know that I let you down

Purpose (Deluxe)
2015
Status Code: 200
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake!
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I don't but, you still hit my phone up

And baby I'll be movin' on

And I think it should be somethin'

That I don't wanna hold back

Maybe you should know that



My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

And I never like to admit that I was wrong

And I've been so caught up in my job,

Didn't see what's going on

But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



But when you told me that you hated my friends

The only problem was with you and not them

And every time you told me my opinion was wrong

And tried to make me forget where I came from



And I didn't wanna write a song

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I don't but, you still hit my phone up

And baby I'll be movin' on

And I think it should be somethin'

That I don't wanna hold back

Maybe you should know that



My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

And I never like to admit that I was wrong

And I've been so caught up in my job

Didn't see what's going on

And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



For all the times that you made me feel small

I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all

I never felt so low when I was vulnerable

Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



Ooh, ooh... 



I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to

But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two

I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth

Can we both say the words and forget this? Yeah



Is it too late now to say sorry?

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

Is it too late now to say sorry?

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



I'm not just trying to get you back on me (oh no no)

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

Is it too late now to say sorry?

Yeah I know that I let you down

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Your back beneath the sun

Wishin' I could write my name on it

Will you call when you're back at school?

I remember thinkin' I had you



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Back when we were still changin' for the better

Wanting was enough

For me, it was enough

To live for the hope of it all

Canceled plans just in case you'd call

And say, "Meet me behind the mall"

So much for summer love and saying "us"

'Cause you weren't mine to lose

You weren't mine to lose, oh



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



'Cause you were never mine

Never mine

But do you remember?

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)

For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake!
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I don't but, you still hit my phone up

And baby I'll be movin' on

And I think it should be somethin'

That I don't wanna hold back

Maybe you should know that



My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

And I never like to admit that I was wrong

And I've been so caught up in my job,

Didn't see what's going on

But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



But when you told me that you hated my friends

The only problem was with you and not them

And every time you told me my opinion was wrong

And tried to make me forget where I came from



And I didn't wanna write a song

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I don't but, you still hit my phone up

And baby I'll be movin' on

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

For all the times that you made me feel small

I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all

I never felt so low when I was vulnerable

Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?

By once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times

So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight

'Cause I just need one more shot at second chance



Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?

Ooh, ooh... 



I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to

But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two

I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth

Can we both say the words and forget this? Yeah

And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake!
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I don't but, you still hit my phone up

And baby I'll be movin' on

And I think it should be somethin'

That I don't wanna hold back

Maybe you should know that



My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

And I never like to admit that I was wrong

And I've been so caught up in my job,

Didn't see what's going on

But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself

The only problem was with you and not them

And every time you told me my opinion was wrong

You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover



We could let our friends crash in the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover



Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue

All’s well that ends well to end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my

Oh, you're my, my, my, my

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Your back beneath the sun

Wishin' I could write my name on it

Will you call when you're back at school?

I remember thinkin' I had you



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Back when we were still changin' for the better

Wanting was enough

For me, it was enough

To live for the hope of it all

Canceled plans just in case you'd call

And say, "Meet me behind the mall"

So much for summer love and saying "us"

'Cause you weren't mine to lose

You weren't mine to lose, oh



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



'Cause you were never mine

Never mine

But do you remember?

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)

For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequined smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Dancin' in your Levi's

Drunk under a streetlight, I

I knew you

Hand under my sweatshirt

Baby, kiss it better, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



A friend to all is a friend to none

Chase two girls, lose the one

When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Playing hide-and-seek and

Giving me your weekends, I

I knew you

Your heartbeat on the High Line

Once in twenty lifetimes, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



To kiss in cars and downtown bars

Was all we needed

You drew stars around my scars

But now I'm bleedin'



'Cause I knew you

Steppin' on the last train

Marked me like a bloodstain, I

I knew you

Tried to change the ending

Peter losing Wendy, I

I knew you

Leavin' like a father

Running like water, I

And when you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

The smell of smoke would hang around this long

'Cause I knew everything when I was young

I knew I'd curse you for the longest time

Chasin' shadows in the grocery line

I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired

And you'd be standin' in my front porch light

And I knew you'd come back to me

You'd come back to me

And you'd come back to me

And you'd come back



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite

I was supposed to be sent away, 
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame

But what about your quiet treason?



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her



All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, but I touched you



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater

Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors

My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him



I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you

I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you



Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till you touch, touch, touch me

Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till I touch, touch, touch you

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and

Toyin' with them older guys

Just playthings for me to use

Something happened for the first time, in

The darkest little paradise, shakin'

Pacin', I just need you



For you, I would cross the line

I would waste my time

I would lose my mind

They say she's gone too far this time



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



My name is whatever you decide

And I'm just gonna call you mine

I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)

Echoes of your name inside my mind

Halo, hiding my obsession

I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy



And baby, for you, I would fall from grace

Just to touch your face

If you walk away

I'd beg you on my knees to stay



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



I get so high, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

You're lovin' me

Trip of my life, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're touchin' me

You're touchin' me

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

Oh, Lord, save me

My drug is my baby

I'd be usin' for the rest of my life

(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh)



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (doin' it right, no)

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life, oh

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (you ain't doin' it...)

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices

They come with prices and vices

I end up in crisis

I've realized all this time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

Cuz you got tired of my scheming

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill

Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed



Did you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism

Like some kind of congressman

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

And life will lose all of its meaning

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money

She thinks I left them in the will

The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out

"She's laughing up at us from hell!"



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, everybody agrees

Everybody agrees...



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

Everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?

'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness



I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice

By once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times

So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight

'Cause I just need one more shot at second chance



Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to

But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two

I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth

Can we both say the words and forget this? Yeah

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake!
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I don't but, you still hit my phone up

And baby I'll be movin' on

And I think it should be somethin'

That I don't wanna hold back

Maybe you should know that



My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

And I never like to admit that I was wrong

And I've been so caught up in my job,

Didn't see what's going on

But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



But when you told me that you hated my friends

The only problem was with you and not them

And every time you told me my opinion was wrong

And tried to make me forget where I came from



And I didn't wanna write a song

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I don't but, you still hit my phone up

And baby I'll be movin' on

And I think it should be somethin'

That I don't wanna hold back

Maybe you should know that



My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

And I never like to admit that I was wrong

And I've been so caught up in my job

Didn't see what's going on

And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



For all the times that you made me feel small

I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all

I never felt so low when I was vulnerable

Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover



We could let our friends crash in the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover



Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue

All’s well that ends well to end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my

Oh, you're my, my, my, my

Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Your back beneath the sun

Wishin' I could write my name on it

Will you call when you're back at school?

I remember thinkin' I had you



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Back when we were still changin' for the better

Wanting was enough

For me, it was enough

To live for the hope of it all

Canceled plans just in case you'd call

And say, "Meet me behind the mall"

So much for summer love and saying "us"

'Cause you weren't mine to lose

You weren't mine to lose, oh



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine

Never mine

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

The smell of smoke would hang around this long

'Cause I knew everything when I was young

I knew I'd curse you for the longest time

Chasin' shadows in the grocery line

I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired

I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame

But what about your quiet treason?



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her



All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, but I touched you

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and

Toyin' with them older guys

Just playthings for me to use

Something happened for the first time, in

The darkest little paradise, shakin'

Pacin', I just need you



For you, I would cross the line

I would waste my time

I would lose my mind

They say she's gone too far this time



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



My name is whatever you decide

And I'm just gonna call you mine

I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)

Echoes of your name inside my mind

Halo, hiding my obsession

I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy



And baby, for you, I would fall from grace

Just to touch your face

If you walk away

I'd beg you on my knees to stay



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices

They come with prices and vices

I end up in crisis

I've realized all this time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

Cuz you got tired of my scheming

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill

Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed



Did you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism

Like some kind of congressman

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

And life will lose all of its meaning

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money

She thinks I left them in the will

The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out

"She's laughing up at us from hell!"



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, everybody agrees

Everybody agrees...



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

Everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till I touch, touch, touch you

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and

Toyin' with them older guys

Just playthings for me to use

Something happened for the first time, in

The darkest little paradise, shakin'

Pacin', I just need you



For you, I would cross the line

I would waste my time

I would lose my mind

They say she's gone too far this time



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



My name is whatever you decide

And I'm just gonna call you mine

I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)

Echoes of your name inside my mind

Halo, hiding my obsession

I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy



And baby, for you, I would fall from grace

Just to touch your face

If you walk away

I'd beg you on my knees to stay



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



I get so high, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

You're lovin' me

Trip of my life, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're touchin' me

You're touchin' me

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

Oh, Lord, save me

My drug is my baby

I'd be usin' for the rest of my life

(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh)



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (doin' it right, no)

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life, oh

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (you ain't doin' it...)

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')



I get so high, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

You're lovin' me

Oh, Lord, save me

My drug is my baby

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices

They come with prices and vices

I end up in crisis

I've realized all this time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

Cuz you got tired of my scheming

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill

Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed



Did you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism

Like some kind of congressman

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

And life will lose all of its meaning

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money

She thinks I left them in the will

The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out

"She's laughing up at us from hell!"



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, everybody agrees

Everybody agrees...



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

Everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover



We could let our friends crash in the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover



Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue

All’s well that ends well to end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my

Oh, you're my, my, my, my

Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Your back beneath the sun

Wishin' I could write my name on it

Will you call when you're back at school?

I remember thinkin' I had you



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Back when we were still changin' for the better

Wanting was enough

For me, it was enough

To live for the hope of it all

Canceled plans just in case you'd call

And say, "Meet me behind the mall"

So much for summer love and saying "us"

'Cause you weren't mine to lose

You weren't mine to lose, oh



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



'Cause you were never mine

Never mine

But do you remember?

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)

For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequined smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Dancin' in your Levi's

Drunk under a streetlight, I

I knew you

Hand under my sweatshirt

Baby, kiss it better, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



A friend to all is a friend to none

Chase two girls, lose the one

When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Playing hide-and-seek and

Giving me your weekends, I

I knew you

Your heartbeat on the High Line

Once in twenty lifetimes, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



To kiss in cars and downtown bars

Was all we needed

You drew stars around my scars

But now I'm bleedin'



'Cause I knew you

Steppin' on the last train

Marked me like a bloodstain, I

I knew you

Tried to change the ending

Peter losing Wendy, I

I knew you

Leavin' like a father

Running like water, I

And when you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

The smell of smoke would hang around this long

'Cause I knew everything when I was young

I knew I'd curse you for the longest time

Chasin' shadows in the grocery line

I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired

And you'd be standin' in my front porch light

And I knew you'd come back to me

You'd come back to me

And you'd come back to me

And you'd come back



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite

I was supposed to be sent away, 
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame

But what about your quiet treason?



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her



All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, but I touched you



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater

Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors

My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him



I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you

I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you



Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till you touch, touch, touch me

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill

Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed



Did you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism

Like some kind of congressman

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

And life will lose all of its meaning

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money

She thinks I left them in the will

The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out

"She's laughing up at us from hell!"



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, everybody agrees

Everybody agrees...



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

Everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

I used to believe
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful
Selling a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle
On a miracle

Say, go through the darkest of days

Heaven's a heartbreak away

Never let you go, never let me down

Oh, it's been a hell of a ride

Driving the edge of a knife

Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah

I won't give up, nah-nah-nah

Let me love you

Let me love you

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah

I won't give up, nah-nah-nah

Let me love you

Let me love you

Oh baby, baby

Don't fall asleep

At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us

Miles ahead of us

All that we need

Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough

Know we're good enough

Say go through the darkest of days

Heaven's a heartbreak away

Never let you go, never let me down

Oh it's been a hell of a ride

Driving the edge of a knife

Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah

I won't give up, nah-nah-nah

Let me love you

Let me love you

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake!
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I don't but, you still hit my phone up

And baby I'll be movin' on

And I think it should be somethin'

That I don't wanna hold back

Maybe you should know that



My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

And I never like to admit that I was wrong

And I've been so caught up in my job,

Didn't see what's going on

But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



But when you told me that you hated my friends

The only problem was with you and not them

And every time you told me my opinion was wrong

And tried to make me forget where I came from



And I didn't wanna write a song

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I don't but, you still hit my phone up

And baby I'll be movin' on

And I think it should be somethin'

That I don't wanna hold back

Maybe you should know that



My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

And I never like to admit that I was wrong

And I've been so caught up in my job

Didn't see what's going on

And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



For all the times that you made me feel small

I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all

I never felt so low when I was vulnerable

Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

Oooh, ooh...
Oooh, ooh...
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?

'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness



I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice

By once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times

So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight

'Cause I just need one more shot at second chance



Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

Is it too late now to say sorry?

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



Ooh, ooh... I'm sorry, yeah

Ooh, ooh... Sorry, yeah

Ooh, ooh.. Sorry

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



Ooh, ooh... 



I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to

But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two

I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth

Can we both say the words and forget this? Yeah



Is it too late now to say sorry?

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

Is it too late now to say sorry?

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



I'm not just trying to get you back on me (oh no no)

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

Is it too late now to say sorry?

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?





Ooh, ooh... I'm sorry, yeah

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover



We could let our friends crash in the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover



Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue

All’s well that ends well to end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my

Oh, you're my, my, my, my

Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Your back beneath the sun

Wishin' I could write my name on it

Will you call when you're back at school?

I remember thinkin' I had you



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Back when we were still changin' for the better

Wanting was enough

For me, it was enough

To live for the hope of it all

Canceled plans just in case you'd call

And say, "Meet me behind the mall"

So much for summer love and saying "us"

'Cause you weren't mine to lose

You weren't mine to lose, oh



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



'Cause you were never mine

Never mine

But do you remember?

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall")

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequined smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Dancin' in your Levi's

Drunk under a streetlight, I

I knew you

Hand under my sweatshirt

Baby, kiss it better, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



A friend to all is a friend to none

Chase two girls, lose the one

When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Playing hide-and-seek and

Giving me your weekends, I

I knew you

Your heartbeat on the High Line

Once in twenty lifetimes, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



To kiss in cars and downtown bars

Was all we needed

You drew stars around my scars

But now I'm bleedin'



'Cause I knew you

Steppin' on the last train

Marked me like a bloodstain, I

I knew you

Tried to change the ending

Peter losing Wendy, I

I knew you

Leavin' like a father

Running like water, I

And when you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

The smell of smoke would hang around this long

'Cause I knew everything when I was young

I knew I'd curse you for the longest time

Chasin' shadows in the grocery line

I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired

And you'd be standin' in my front porch light

And I knew you'd come back to me

You'd come back to me

And you'd come back to me

And you'd come back



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite

I was supposed to be sent away, 
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame

But what about your quiet treason?



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her



All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, but I touched you



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater

Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors

My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him



I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you



Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till you touch, touch, touch me

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and

Toyin' with them older guys

Just playthings for me to use

Something happened for the first time, in

The darkest little paradise, shakin'

Pacin', I just need you



For you, I would cross the line

I would waste my time

I would lose my mind

They say she's gone too far this time

And I'm just gonna call you mine

I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)

Echoes of your name inside my mind

Halo, hiding my obsession

I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy



And baby, for you, I would fall from grace

Just to touch your face

If you walk away

I'd beg you on my knees to stay



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices

They come with prices and vices

I end up in crisis

I've realized all this time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

Cuz you got tired of my scheming

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill

Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed



Did you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism

Like some kind of congressman

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

And life will lose all of its meaning

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover



We could let our friends crash in the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover



Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue

All’s well that ends well to end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my

Oh, you're my, my, my, my

Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Your back beneath the sun

Wishin' I could write my name on it

Will you call when you're back at school?

I remember thinkin' I had you



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Back when we were still changin' for the better

Wanting was enough

For me, it was enough

To live for the hope of it all

Canceled plans just in case you'd call

And say, "Meet me behind the mall"

So much for summer love and saying "us"

'Cause you weren't mine to lose

You weren't mine to lose, oh



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



'Cause you were never mine

Never mine

But do you remember?

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)

For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequined smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Dancin' in your Levi's

Drunk under a streetlight, I

I knew you

Hand under my sweatshirt

Baby, kiss it better, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



A friend to all is a friend to none

Chase two girls, lose the one

When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Playing hide-and-seek and

Giving me your weekends, I

I knew you

Your heartbeat on the High Line

Once in twenty lifetimes, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



To kiss in cars and downtown bars

Was all we needed

You drew stars around my scars

But now I'm bleedin'



'Cause I knew you

Steppin' on the last train

Marked me like a bloodstain, I

I knew you

Tried to change the ending

Peter losing Wendy, I

I knew you

Leavin' like a father

Running like water, I

And when you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

The smell of smoke would hang around this long

'Cause I knew everything when I was young

I knew I'd curse you for the longest time

Chasin' shadows in the grocery line

I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired

And you'd be standin' in my front porch light

And I knew you'd come back to me

You'd come back to me

And you'd come back to me

And you'd come back



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite

I was supposed to be sent away, 
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame

But what about your quiet treason?



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her



All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, but I touched you



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater

Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors

My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him



I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you

I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you



Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till you touch, touch, touch me

Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till I touch, touch, touch you

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and

Toyin' with them older guys

Just playthings for me to use

Something happened for the first time, in

The darkest little paradise, shakin'

Pacin', I just need you



For you, I would cross the line

I would waste my time

I would lose my mind

They say she's gone too far this time



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



My name is whatever you decide

And I'm just gonna call you mine

I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)

Echoes of your name inside my mind

Halo, hiding my obsession

I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy



And baby, for you, I would fall from grace

Just to touch your face

If you walk away

I'd beg you on my knees to stay



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



I get so high, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

You're lovin' me

Trip of my life, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're touchin' me

You're touchin' me

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

Oh, Lord, save me

My drug is my baby

I'd be usin' for the rest of my life

(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh)



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (doin' it right, no)

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life, oh

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (you ain't doin' it...)

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices

They come with prices and vices

I end up in crisis

I've realized all this time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

Cuz you got tired of my scheming

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill

Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed



Did you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism

Like some kind of congressman

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

And life will lose all of its meaning

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money

She thinks I left them in the will

The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out

"She's laughing up at us from hell!"



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, everybody agrees

Everybody agrees...



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

Everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?

'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness



I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice

By once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times

So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight

'Cause I just need one more shot at second chance



Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

Is it too late now to say sorry?

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



Ooh, ooh... I'm sorry, yeah

Ooh, ooh... Sorry, yeah

Ooh, ooh.. Sorry

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



Ooh, ooh... 



I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to

But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two

I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth

Can we both say the words and forget this? Yeah



Is it too late now to say sorry?

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

Is it too late now to say sorry?

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



I'm not just trying to get you back on me (oh no no)

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

Is it too late now to say sorry?

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?





Ooh, ooh... I'm sorry, yeah

Ooh, ooh... Sorry, oh

Ooh, ooh... Sorry

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



Ooh, ooh... I'm sorry, yeah

Ooh, ooh... Sorry, oh

Ooh, ooh... Sorry

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover



We could let our friends crash in the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover



Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue

All’s well that ends well to end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my

Oh, you're my, my, my, my

Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Your back beneath the sun

Wishin' I could write my name on it

Will you call when you're back at school?

I remember thinkin' I had you



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Back when we were still changin' for the better

Wanting was enough

For me, it was enough

To live for the hope of it all

Canceled plans just in case you'd call

And say, "Meet me behind the mall"

So much for summer love and saying "us"

'Cause you weren't mine to lose

You weren't mine to lose, oh



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



'Cause you were never mine

Never mine

But do you remember?

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)

For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequined smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Dancin' in your Levi's

Drunk under a streetlight, I

I knew you

Hand under my sweatshirt

Baby, kiss it better, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



A friend to all is a friend to none

Chase two girls, lose the one

When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Playing hide-and-seek and

Giving me your weekends, I

I knew you

Your heartbeat on the High Line

Once in twenty lifetimes, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



To kiss in cars and downtown bars

Was all we needed

You drew stars around my scars

But now I'm bleedin'



'Cause I knew you

Steppin' on the last train

Marked me like a bloodstain, I

I knew you

Tried to change the ending

Peter losing Wendy, I

I knew you

Leavin' like a father

Running like water, I

And when you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

The smell of smoke would hang around this long

'Cause I knew everything when I was young

I knew I'd curse you for the longest time

Chasin' shadows in the grocery line

I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired

And you'd be standin' in my front porch light

And I knew you'd come back to me

You'd come back to me

And you'd come back to me

And you'd come back



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite

I was supposed to be sent away, 
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame

But what about your quiet treason?



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her



All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, but I touched you



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and

Toyin' with them older guys

Just playthings for me to use

Something happened for the first time, in

The darkest little paradise, shakin'

Pacin', I just need you



For you, I would cross the line

I would waste my time

I would lose my mind

They say she's gone too far this time

My name is whatever you decide

And I'm just gonna call you mine

I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)

Echoes of your name inside my mind

Halo, hiding my obsession

I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy



And baby, for you, I would fall from grace

Just to touch your face

If you walk away

I'd beg you on my knees to stay



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices

They come with prices and vices

I end up in crisis

I've realized all this time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

Cuz you got tired of my scheming

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill

Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed



Did you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism

Like some kind of congressman

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

And life will lose all of its meaning

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money

She thinks I left them in the will

The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out

"She's laughing up at us from hell!"



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, everybody agrees

Everybody agrees...



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

Everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover



We could let our friends crash in the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover



Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue

All’s well that ends well to end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my

Oh, you're my, my, my, my

Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Your back beneath the sun

Wishin' I could write my name on it

Will you call when you're back at school?

I remember thinkin' I had you



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Back when we were still changin' for the better

Wanting was enough

For me, it was enough

To live for the hope of it all

Canceled plans just in case you'd call

And say, "Meet me behind the mall"

So much for summer love and saying "us"

'Cause you weren't mine to lose

You weren't mine to lose, oh



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



'Cause you were never mine

Never mine

But do you remember?

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)

For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequined smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Dancin' in your Levi's

Drunk under a streetlight, I

I knew you

Hand under my sweatshirt

Baby, kiss it better, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



A friend to all is a friend to none

Chase two girls, lose the one

When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Playing hide-and-seek and

Giving me your weekends, I

I knew you

Your heartbeat on the High Line

Once in twenty lifetimes, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



To kiss in cars and downtown bars

Was all we needed

You drew stars around my scars

But now I'm bleedin'



'Cause I knew you

Steppin' on the last train

Marked me like a bloodstain, I

I knew you

Tried to change the ending

Peter losing Wendy, I

I knew you

Leavin' like a father

Running like water, I

And when you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

The smell of smoke would hang around this long

'Cause I knew everything when I was young

I knew I'd curse you for the longest time

Chasin' shadows in the grocery line

I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired

And you'd be standin' in my front porch light

And I knew you'd come back to me

You'd come back to me

And you'd come back to me

And you'd come back



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite

I was supposed to be sent away, 
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame

But what about your quiet treason?



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her



All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, but I touched you



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater

Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors

My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him



I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you

I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you



Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till you touch, touch, touch me

Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and

Toyin' with them older guys

Just playthings for me to use

Something happened for the first time, in

The darkest little paradise, shakin'

Pacin', I just need you



For you, I would cross the line

I would waste my time

I would lose my mind

They say she's gone too far this time



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



My name is whatever you decide

And I'm just gonna call you mine

I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)

Echoes of your name inside my mind

Halo, hiding my obsession

I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy



And baby, for you, I would fall from grace

Just to touch your face

If you walk away

I'd beg you on my knees to stay



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



I get so high, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

You're lovin' me

Trip of my life, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're touchin' me

You're touchin' me

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

Oh, Lord, save me

My drug is my baby

I'd be usin' for the rest of my life

(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh)



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (doin' it right, no)

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (you ain't doin' it...)

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices

They come with prices and vices

I end up in crisis

I've realized all this time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

Cuz you got tired of my scheming

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill

Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed



Did you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism

Like some kind of congressman

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

And life will lose all of its meaning

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money

She thinks I left them in the will

The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out

"She's laughing up at us from hell!"



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, everybody agrees

Everybody agrees...



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

Everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover



We could let our friends crash in the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover



Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue

All’s well that ends well to end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my

Oh, you're my, my, my, my

Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Your back beneath the sun

Wishin' I could write my name on it

Will you call when you're back at school?

I remember thinkin' I had you



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Back when we were still changin' for the better

Wanting was enough

For me, it was enough

To live for the hope of it all

Canceled plans just in case you'd call

And say, "Meet me behind the mall"

So much for summer love and saying "us"

'Cause you weren't mine to lose

You weren't mine to lose, oh



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



'Cause you were never mine

Never mine

But do you remember?

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)

For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequined smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Dancin' in your Levi's

Drunk under a streetlight, I

I knew you

Hand under my sweatshirt

Baby, kiss it better, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



A friend to all is a friend to none

Chase two girls, lose the one

When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Playing hide-and-seek and

Giving me your weekends, I

I knew you

Your heartbeat on the High Line

Once in twenty lifetimes, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



To kiss in cars and downtown bars

Was all we needed

You drew stars around my scars

But now I'm bleedin'



'Cause I knew you

Steppin' on the last train

Marked me like a bloodstain, I

I knew you

Tried to change the ending

Peter losing Wendy, I

I knew you

Leavin' like a father

Running like water, I

And when you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

The smell of smoke would hang around this long

'Cause I knew everything when I was young

I knew I'd curse you for the longest time

Chasin' shadows in the grocery line

I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired

And you'd be standin' in my front porch light

And I knew you'd come back to me

You'd come back to me

And you'd come back to me

And you'd come back



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite

I was supposed to be sent away, 
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame

But what about your quiet treason?



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her



All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, but I touched you



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater

Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors

My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him



I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you

I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you



Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till you touch, touch, touch me

Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till I touch, touch, touch you

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and

Toyin' with them older guys

Just playthings for me to use

Something happened for the first time, in

The darkest little paradise, shakin'

Pacin', I just need you



For you, I would cross the line

I would waste my time

I would lose my mind

They say she's gone too far this time



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



My name is whatever you decide

And I'm just gonna call you mine

I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)

Echoes of your name inside my mind

Halo, hiding my obsession

I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy



And baby, for you, I would fall from grace

Just to touch your face

If you walk away

I'd beg you on my knees to stay



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



I get so high, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

You're lovin' me

Trip of my life, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're touchin' me

You're touchin' me

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

Oh, Lord, save me

My drug is my baby

I'd be usin' for the rest of my life

(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh)



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (doin' it right, no)

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (you ain't doin' it...)

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices

They come with prices and vices

I end up in crisis

I've realized all this time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

Cuz you got tired of my scheming

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill

Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed



Did you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism

Like some kind of congressman

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

And life will lose all of its meaning

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money

She thinks I left them in the will

The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out

"She's laughing up at us from hell!"



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, everybody agrees

Everybody agrees...



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

Everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover



We could let our friends crash in the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover



Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue

All’s well that ends well to end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my

Oh, you're my, my, my, my

Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Your back beneath the sun

Wishin' I could write my name on it

Will you call when you're back at school?

I remember thinkin' I had you



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Back when we were still changin' for the better

Wanting was enough

For me, it was enough

To live for the hope of it all

Canceled plans just in case you'd call

And say, "Meet me behind the mall"

So much for summer love and saying "us"

'Cause you weren't mine to lose

You weren't mine to lose, oh



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



'Cause you were never mine

Never mine

But do you remember?

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)

For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequined smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Dancin' in your Levi's

Drunk under a streetlight, I

I knew you

Hand under my sweatshirt

Baby, kiss it better, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



A friend to all is a friend to none

Chase two girls, lose the one

When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Playing hide-and-seek and

Giving me your weekends, I

I knew you

Your heartbeat on the High Line

Once in twenty lifetimes, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



To kiss in cars and downtown bars

Was all we needed

You drew stars around my scars

But now I'm bleedin'



'Cause I knew you

Steppin' on the last train

Marked me like a bloodstain, I

I knew you

Tried to change the ending

Peter losing Wendy, I

I knew you

Leavin' like a father

Running like water, I

And when you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

The smell of smoke would hang around this long

'Cause I knew everything when I was young

I knew I'd curse you for the longest time

Chasin' shadows in the grocery line

I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired

And you'd be standin' in my front porch light

And I knew you'd come back to me

You'd come back to me

And you'd come back to me

And you'd come back



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite

I was supposed to be sent away, 
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame

But what about your quiet treason?



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her



All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, but I touched you



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater

Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors

My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him



I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you

I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you



Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till you touch, touch, touch me

Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till I touch, touch, touch you

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and

Toyin' with them older guys

Just playthings for me to use

Something happened for the first time, in

The darkest little paradise, shakin'

Pacin', I just need you



For you, I would cross the line

I would waste my time

I would lose my mind

They say she's gone too far this time



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



My name is whatever you decide

And I'm just gonna call you mine

I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)

Echoes of your name inside my mind

Halo, hiding my obsession

I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy



And baby, for you, I would fall from grace

Just to touch your face

If you walk away

I'd beg you on my knees to stay



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



I get so high, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

You're lovin' me

Trip of my life, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're touchin' me

You're touchin' me

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

Oh, Lord, save me

My drug is my baby

I'd be usin' for the rest of my life

(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh)



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (doin' it right, no)

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life, oh

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (you ain't doin' it...)

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')



I get so high, oh

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices

They come with prices and vices

I end up in crisis

I've realized all this time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

Cuz you got tired of my scheming

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill

Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed



Did you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism

Like some kind of congressman

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

And life will lose all of its meaning

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money

She thinks I left them in the will

The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out

"She's laughing up at us from hell!"



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, everybody agrees

Everybody agrees...



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

Everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover



We could let our friends crash in the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover



Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue

All’s well that ends well to end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my

Oh, you're my, my, my, my

Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Your back beneath the sun

Wishin' I could write my name on it

Will you call when you're back at school?

I remember thinkin' I had you



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Back when we were still changin' for the better

Wanting was enough

For me, it was enough

To live for the hope of it all

Canceled plans just in case you'd call

And say, "Meet me behind the mall"

So much for summer love and saying "us"

'Cause you weren't mine to lose

You weren't mine to lose, oh



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



'Cause you were never mine

Never mine

But do you remember?

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)

For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequined smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Dancin' in your Levi's

Drunk under a streetlight, I

I knew you

Hand under my sweatshirt

Baby, kiss it better, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



A friend to all is a friend to none

Chase two girls, lose the one

When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Playing hide-and-seek and

Giving me your weekends, I

I knew you

Your heartbeat on the High Line

Once in twenty lifetimes, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



To kiss in cars and downtown bars

Was all we needed

You drew stars around my scars

But now I'm bleedin'



'Cause I knew you

Steppin' on the last train

Marked me like a bloodstain, I

I knew you

Tried to change the ending

Peter losing Wendy, I

I knew you

Leavin' like a father

Running like water, I

And when you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

The smell of smoke would hang around this long

'Cause I knew everything when I was young

I knew I'd curse you for the longest time

Chasin' shadows in the grocery line

I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired

And you'd be standin' in my front porch light

And I knew you'd come back to me

You'd come back to me

And you'd come back to me

And you'd come back



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite

I was supposed to be sent away, 
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame

But what about your quiet treason?



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her



All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, but I touched you



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater

Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors

My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him



I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you

I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you



Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till you touch, touch, touch me

Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till I touch, touch, touch you

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and

Toyin' with them older guys

Just playthings for me to use

Something happened for the first time, in

The darkest little paradise, shakin'

Pacin', I just need you



For you, I would cross the line

I would waste my time

I would lose my mind

They say she's gone too far this time



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



My name is whatever you decide

And I'm just gonna call you mine

I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)

Echoes of your name inside my mind

Halo, hiding my obsession

I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy



And baby, for you, I would fall from grace

Just to touch your face

If you walk away

I'd beg you on my knees to stay



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



I get so high, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

You're lovin' me

Trip of my life, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're touchin' me

You're touchin' me

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

Oh, Lord, save me

My drug is my baby

I'd be usin' for the rest of my life

(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh)



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (doin' it right, no)

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (you ain't doin' it...)

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices

They come with prices and vices

I end up in crisis

I've realized all this time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

Cuz you got tired of my scheming

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill

Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed



Did you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism

Like some kind of congressman

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

And life will lose all of its meaning

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money

She thinks I left them in the will

The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out

"She's laughing up at us from hell!"



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, everybody agrees

Everybody agrees...



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

Everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover



We could let our friends crash in the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover



Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue

All’s well that ends well to end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my

Oh, you're my, my, my, my

Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Your back beneath the sun

Wishin' I could write my name on it

Will you call when you're back at school?

I remember thinkin' I had you



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Back when we were still changin' for the better

Wanting was enough

For me, it was enough

To live for the hope of it all

Canceled plans just in case you'd call

And say, "Meet me behind the mall"

So much for summer love and saying "us"

'Cause you weren't mine to lose

You weren't mine to lose, oh



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



'Cause you were never mine

Never mine

But do you remember?

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)

For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequined smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Dancin' in your Levi's

Drunk under a streetlight, I

I knew you

Hand under my sweatshirt

Baby, kiss it better, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



A friend to all is a friend to none

Chase two girls, lose the one

When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Playing hide-and-seek and

Giving me your weekends, I

I knew you

Your heartbeat on the High Line

Once in twenty lifetimes, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



To kiss in cars and downtown bars

Was all we needed

You drew stars around my scars

But now I'm bleedin'



'Cause I knew you

Steppin' on the last train

Marked me like a bloodstain, I

I knew you

Tried to change the ending

Peter losing Wendy, I

I knew you

Leavin' like a father

Running like water, I

And when you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

The smell of smoke would hang around this long

'Cause I knew everything when I was young

I knew I'd curse you for the longest time

Chasin' shadows in the grocery line

I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired

And you'd be standin' in my front porch light

And I knew you'd come back to me

You'd come back to me

And you'd come back to me

And you'd come back



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite

I was supposed to be sent away, 
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame

But what about your quiet treason?



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her



All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, but I touched you



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater

Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors

My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him



I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you

I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you



Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till you touch, touch, touch me

Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till I touch, touch, touch you

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and

Toyin' with them older guys

Just playthings for me to use

Something happened for the first time, in

The darkest little paradise, shakin'

Pacin', I just need you



For you, I would cross the line

I would waste my time

I would lose my mind

They say she's gone too far this time



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



My name is whatever you decide

And I'm just gonna call you mine

I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)

Echoes of your name inside my mind

Halo, hiding my obsession

I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy



And baby, for you, I would fall from grace

Just to touch your face

If you walk away

I'd beg you on my knees to stay



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



I get so high, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

You're lovin' me

Trip of my life, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're touchin' me

You're touchin' me

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

Oh, Lord, save me

My drug is my baby

I'd be usin' for the rest of my life

(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh)



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (doin' it right, no)

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life, oh

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (you ain't doin' it...)

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')



I get so high, oh

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices

They come with prices and vices

I end up in crisis

I've realized all this time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

Cuz you got tired of my scheming

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill

Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed



Did you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism

Like some kind of congressman

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

And life will lose all of its meaning

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money

She thinks I left them in the will

The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out

"She's laughing up at us from hell!"



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, everybody agrees

Everybody agrees...



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

Everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover



We could let our friends crash in the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover



Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue

All’s well that ends well to end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my

Oh, you're my, my, my, my

Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Your back beneath the sun

Wishin' I could write my name on it

Will you call when you're back at school?

I remember thinkin' I had you



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Back when we were still changin' for the better

Wanting was enough

For me, it was enough

To live for the hope of it all

Canceled plans just in case you'd call

And say, "Meet me behind the mall"

So much for summer love and saying "us"

'Cause you weren't mine to lose

You weren't mine to lose, oh



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



'Cause you were never mine

Never mine

But do you remember?

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)

For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequined smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Dancin' in your Levi's

Drunk under a streetlight, I

I knew you

Hand under my sweatshirt

Baby, kiss it better, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



A friend to all is a friend to none

Chase two girls, lose the one

When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Playing hide-and-seek and

Giving me your weekends, I

I knew you

Your heartbeat on the High Line

Once in twenty lifetimes, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



To kiss in cars and downtown bars

Was all we needed

You drew stars around my scars

But now I'm bleedin'



'Cause I knew you

Steppin' on the last train

Marked me like a bloodstain, I

I knew you

Tried to change the ending

Peter losing Wendy, I

I knew you

Leavin' like a father

Running like water, I

And when you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

The smell of smoke would hang around this long

'Cause I knew everything when I was young

I knew I'd curse you for the longest time

Chasin' shadows in the grocery line

I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired

And you'd be standin' in my front porch light

And I knew you'd come back to me

You'd come back to me

And you'd come back to me

And you'd come back



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite

I was supposed to be sent away, 
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame

But what about your quiet treason?



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her



All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, but I touched you



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater

Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors

My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him



I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you

I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you



Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till you touch, touch, touch me

Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and

Toyin' with them older guys

Just playthings for me to use

Something happened for the first time, in

The darkest little paradise, shakin'

Pacin', I just need you



For you, I would cross the line

I would waste my time

I would lose my mind

They say she's gone too far this time



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



My name is whatever you decide

And I'm just gonna call you mine

I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)

Echoes of your name inside my mind

Halo, hiding my obsession

I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy



And baby, for you, I would fall from grace

Just to touch your face

If you walk away

I'd beg you on my knees to stay



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I get so high, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

You're lovin' me

Trip of my life, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're touchin' me

You're touchin' me

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

Oh, Lord, save me

My drug is my baby

I'd be usin' for the rest of my life

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices

They come with prices and vices

I end up in crisis

I've realized all this time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

Cuz you got tired of my scheming

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill

Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed



Did you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism

Like some kind of congressman

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

And life will lose all of its meaning

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money

She thinks I left them in the will

The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out

"She's laughing up at us from hell!"



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, everybody agrees

Everybody agrees...



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

Everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

I used to believe
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful
Selling a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle
On a miracle

Say, go through the darkest of days

Heaven's a heartbreak away

Never let you go, never let me down

Oh, it's been a hell of a ride

Driving the edge of a knife

Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah

I won't give up, nah-nah-nah

Let me love you

Let me love you

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah

I won't give up, nah-nah-nah

Let me love you

Let me love you

Oh baby, baby

Don't fall asleep

At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us

Miles ahead of us

All that we need

Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough

Know we're good enough

Say go through the darkest of days

Heaven's a heartbreak away

Never let you go, never let me down

Oh it's been a hell of a ride

Driving the edge of a knife

Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah

I won't give up, nah-nah-nah

Let me love you

Let me love you

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah

I won't give up, nah-nah-nah

Let me love you

Let me love you

Oh baby, baby

Never let you go

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake!
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I don't but, you still hit my phone up

And baby I'll be movin' on

And I think it should be somethin'

That I don't wanna hold back

Maybe you should know that



My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

And I never like to admit that I was wrong

And I've been so caught up in my job,

Didn't see what's going on

But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



But when you told me that you hated my friends

The only problem was with you and not them

And every time you told me my opinion was wrong

And tried to make me forget where I came from



And I didn't wanna write a song

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I don't but, you still hit my phone up

And baby I'll be movin' on

And I think it should be somethin'

That I don't wanna hold back

Maybe you should know that



My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

And I never like to admit that I was wrong

And I've been so caught up in my job

Didn't see what's going on

And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



For all the times that you made me feel small

I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all

I never felt so low when I was vulnerable

Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself

Oooh, ooh...
Oooh, ooh...
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?

'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness



I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice

By once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times

So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight

'Cause I just need one more shot at second chance



Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

Is it too late now to say sorry?

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



Ooh, ooh... I'm sorry, yeah

Ooh, ooh... Sorry, yeah

Ooh, ooh.. Sorry

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



Ooh, ooh... 



I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to

But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two

I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth

Can we both say the words and forget this? Yeah



Is it too late now to say sorry?

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

Is it too late now to say sorry?

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



I'm not just trying to get you back on me (oh no no)

'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh

Is it too late now to say sorry?

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?





Ooh, ooh... I'm sorry, yeah

Ooh, ooh... Sorry, oh

Ooh, ooh... Sorry

Yeah I know that I let you down

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



Ooh, ooh... I'm sorry, yeah

Cruel Summer
Status Code: 200
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover



We could let our friends crash in the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover



Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue

All’s well that ends well to end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my

Oh, you're my, my, my, my

Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Your back beneath the sun

Wishin' I could write my name on it

Will you call when you're back at school?

I remember thinkin' I had you



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Back when we were still changin' for the better

Wanting was enough

For me, it was enough

To live for the hope of it all

Canceled plans just in case you'd call

And say, "Meet me behind the mall"

So much for summer love and saying "us"

'Cause you weren't mine to lose

You weren't mine to lose, oh



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



'Cause you were never mine

Never mine

But do you remember?

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)

For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequined smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Dancin' in your Levi's

Drunk under a streetlight, I

I knew you

Hand under my sweatshirt

Baby, kiss it better, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



A friend to all is a friend to none

Chase two girls, lose the one

When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Playing hide-and-seek and

Giving me your weekends, I

I knew you

Your heartbeat on the High Line

Once in twenty lifetimes, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



To kiss in cars and downtown bars

Was all we needed

You drew stars around my scars

But now I'm bleedin'



'Cause I knew you

Steppin' on the last train

Marked me like a bloodstain, I

I knew you

Tried to change the ending

Peter losing Wendy, I

I knew you

Leavin' like a father

Running like water, I

And when you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

The smell of smoke would hang around this long

'Cause I knew everything when I was young

I knew I'd curse you for the longest time

Chasin' shadows in the grocery line

I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired

And you'd be standin' in my front porch light

And I knew you'd come back to me

You'd come back to me

And you'd come back to me

And you'd come back



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite

I was supposed to be sent away, 
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame

But what about your quiet treason?



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her



All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, but I touched you



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater

Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors

My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him



I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you

I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you



Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till you touch, touch, touch me

Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and

Toyin' with them older guys

Just playthings for me to use

Something happened for the first time, in

The darkest little paradise, shakin'

Pacin', I just need you



For you, I would cross the line

I would waste my time

I would lose my mind

They say she's gone too far this time



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



My name is whatever you decide

And I'm just gonna call you mine

I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)

Echoes of your name inside my mind

Halo, hiding my obsession

I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy



And baby, for you, I would fall from grace

Just to touch your face

If you walk away

I'd beg you on my knees to stay



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



I get so high, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

You're lovin' me

Trip of my life, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're touchin' me

You're touchin' me

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

Oh, Lord, save me

My drug is my baby

I'd be usin' for the rest of my life

(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh)



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (doin' it right, no)

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (you ain't doin' it...)

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices

They come with prices and vices

I end up in crisis

I've realized all this time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

Cuz you got tired of my scheming

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill

Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed



Did you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism

Like some kind of congressman

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

And life will lose all of its meaning

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money

She thinks I left them in the will

The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out

"She's laughing up at us from hell!"



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, everybody agrees

Everybody agrees...



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

Everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover



We could let our friends crash in the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover



Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue

All’s well that ends well to end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my

Oh, you're my, my, my, my

Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Your back beneath the sun

Wishin' I could write my name on it

Will you call when you're back at school?

I remember thinkin' I had you



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Back when we were still changin' for the better

Wanting was enough

For me, it was enough

To live for the hope of it all

Canceled plans just in case you'd call

And say, "Meet me behind the mall"

So much for summer love and saying "us"

'Cause you weren't mine to lose

You weren't mine to lose, oh



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



'Cause you were never mine

Never mine

But do you remember?

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)

For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequined smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Dancin' in your Levi's

Drunk under a streetlight, I

I knew you

Hand under my sweatshirt

Baby, kiss it better, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



A friend to all is a friend to none

Chase two girls, lose the one

When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Playing hide-and-seek and

Giving me your weekends, I

I knew you

Your heartbeat on the High Line

Once in twenty lifetimes, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



To kiss in cars and downtown bars

Was all we needed

You drew stars around my scars

But now I'm bleedin'



'Cause I knew you

Steppin' on the last train

Marked me like a bloodstain, I

I knew you

Tried to change the ending

Peter losing Wendy, I

I knew you

Leavin' like a father

Running like water, I

And when you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

The smell of smoke would hang around this long

'Cause I knew everything when I was young

I knew I'd curse you for the longest time

Chasin' shadows in the grocery line

I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired

And you'd be standin' in my front porch light

And I knew you'd come back to me

You'd come back to me

And you'd come back to me

And you'd come back



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite

I was supposed to be sent away, 
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame

But what about your quiet treason?



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her



All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, but I touched you



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater

Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors

My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him



I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you

I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you



Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till you touch, touch, touch me

Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till I touch, touch, touch you

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and

Toyin' with them older guys

Just playthings for me to use

Something happened for the first time, in

The darkest little paradise, shakin'

Pacin', I just need you



For you, I would cross the line

I would waste my time

I would lose my mind

They say she's gone too far this time



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



My name is whatever you decide

And I'm just gonna call you mine

I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)

Echoes of your name inside my mind

Halo, hiding my obsession

I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy



And baby, for you, I would fall from grace

Just to touch your face

If you walk away

I'd beg you on my knees to stay



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



I get so high, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

You're lovin' me

Trip of my life, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're touchin' me

You're touchin' me

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

Oh, Lord, save me

My drug is my baby

I'd be usin' for the rest of my life

(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh)



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (doin' it right, no)

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (you ain't doin' it...)

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices

They come with prices and vices

I end up in crisis

I've realized all this time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

Cuz you got tired of my scheming

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill

Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed



Did you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism

Like some kind of congressman

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

And life will lose all of its meaning

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money

She thinks I left them in the will

The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out

"She's laughing up at us from hell!"



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, everybody agrees

Everybody agrees...



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

Everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

"I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover



We could let our friends crash in the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover



Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue

All’s well that ends well to end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover



Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close forever and ever?

And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my

Oh, you're my, my, my, my

Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Your back beneath the sun

Wishin' I could write my name on it

Will you call when you're back at school?

I remember thinkin' I had you



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



Back when we were still changin' for the better

Wanting was enough

For me, it was enough

To live for the hope of it all

Canceled plans just in case you'd call

And say, "Meet me behind the mall"

So much for summer love and saying "us"

'Cause you weren't mine to lose

You weren't mine to lose, oh



But I can see us lost in the memory

August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



'Cause you were never mine

Never mine

But do you remember?

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

"Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)

For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequined smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Dancin' in your Levi's

Drunk under a streetlight, I

I knew you

Hand under my sweatshirt

Baby, kiss it better, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



A friend to all is a friend to none

Chase two girls, lose the one

When you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you

Playing hide-and-seek and

Giving me your weekends, I

I knew you

Your heartbeat on the High Line

Once in twenty lifetimes, I



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite



To kiss in cars and downtown bars

Was all we needed

You drew stars around my scars

But now I'm bleedin'



'Cause I knew you

Steppin' on the last train

Marked me like a bloodstain, I

I knew you

Tried to change the ending

Peter losing Wendy, I

I knew you

Leavin' like a father

Running like water, I

And when you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

The smell of smoke would hang around this long

'Cause I knew everything when I was young

I knew I'd curse you for the longest time

Chasin' shadows in the grocery line

I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired

And you'd be standin' in my front porch light

And I knew you'd come back to me

You'd come back to me

And you'd come back to me

And you'd come back



And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

Under someone's bed

You put me on and said I was your favorite

I was supposed to be sent away, 
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame

But what about your quiet treason?



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her



All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, but I touched you



And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater

Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors

My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him



I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you

I love you, it's ruining my life

I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you



Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till you touch, touch, touch me

Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up

Another fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up till I touch, touch, touch you

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and

Toyin' with them older guys

Just playthings for me to use

Something happened for the first time, in

The darkest little paradise, shakin'

Pacin', I just need you



For you, I would cross the line

I would waste my time

I would lose my mind

They say she's gone too far this time



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



My name is whatever you decide

And I'm just gonna call you mine

I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)

Echoes of your name inside my mind

Halo, hiding my obsession

I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy



And baby, for you, I would fall from grace

Just to touch your face

If you walk away

I'd beg you on my knees to stay



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life



I get so high, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

You're lovin' me

Trip of my life, oh

Every time, yeah, every time you're touchin' me

You're touchin' me

Every time, yeah, every time you're lovin' me

Oh, Lord, save me

My drug is my baby

I'd be usin' for the rest of my life

(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh)



Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (doin' it right, no)

Don't blame me, your love made me crazy

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (you ain't doin' it...)

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices

They come with prices and vices

I end up in crisis

I've realized all this time

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

Cuz you got tired of my scheming

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill

Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed



Did you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism

Like some kind of congressman

I wake up screaming from dreaming

One day I'll watch as you're leaving

And life will lose all of its meaning

For the last time



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

At tea time, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero



I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money

She thinks I left them in the will

The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out

"She's laughing up at us from hell!"



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi, everybody agrees

Everybody agrees...



It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

Everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero
